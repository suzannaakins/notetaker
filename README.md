# Notetaker

## Description
This app allows the user to take notes, and saves them to the webpage.  If they no longer need the note, then they can delete it.  I was responsible for the backend.  The HTML, CSS, and frontend Javascript was delivered to me.  I then created get and post requests to handle to data, which I stored in a JSON array. The biggest challenge was getting the notes to delete.  I set up the function to search through the notes' ids, but the function wasn't working.
