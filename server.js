// Getting Started
// The application should have a db.json file on the back end that will be used to store and retrieve notes using the fs module.
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const express = require('express');
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001;
const app = express();
//parse incoming string or array data
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
//parse incoming JSON data
app.use(express.json());
const { notes } = require('./db/db');

// GET /notes should return the notes.html file.
app.get('/notes', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, './public/notes.html'));
});

// GET * should return the index.html file.
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, './public/index.html'));
});

// The following API routes should be created:

// POST /api/notes should receive a new note to save on the request body, add it to the db.json file, and then return the new note to the client. You'll need to find a way to give each note a unique id when it's saved (look into npm packages that could do this for you).

app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`API server now on port ${PORT}!`);
});


// Bonus
// You havenâ€™t learned how to handle DELETE requests, but this application has that functionality in the front end. As a bonus, see if you can add the DELETE route to the application using the following guideline:

// DELETE /api/notes/:id should receive a query parameter containing the id of a note to delete. In order to delete a note, you'll need to read all notes from the db.json file, remove the note with the given id property, and then rewrite the notes to the db.json file.
